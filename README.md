# Fair-Rations-algo
This C++ program solves the Fair Rations problem by allocating the loaves of bread so that all ration counts become even. The program loops through the array, allocating one loaf to each individual with an odd ration count and their following neighbor, and then verifies if the last person ends up with an even count.
